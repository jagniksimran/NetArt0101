    <p> When Simran was in class eight, She inherited the ipod classic from her brother because he got a phone. She was thrilled, she used to carry it everywhere, watch so many movies. She binge watched How I met your Mother? but didn't understand how sexual the content was.  <br>

        <br>
        She tried to explore her brother's phone, which was touch screen but wasn't allowed to touch it because of privacy reasons.
