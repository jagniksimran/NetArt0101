    <p> When did you first get WiFi, nobody remembers, atleast Simran doesn't but she does remember her home computer being connected to the internet. She by now actually knew how to play pc games like her brother. She started with Age of Empires, dominations and Need for speed. She was addicted but she wasn't allowed to play for more than 2-3 hours in a week.

            Simran also remembers that ipod classic had 3 fun games, she exploited that at night as well.
