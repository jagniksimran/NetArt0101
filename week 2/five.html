    <p> When Simran was in fifth class she got access to her father's laptop on Sundays for a few hours. That was the time she spend playing online games.
        There was a game called Skyrama that kinda became her favourite.

            Simran's mother got her first phone that Simran spent a lot to time changing its settings and customising it.
