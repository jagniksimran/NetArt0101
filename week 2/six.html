    <p> When Simran was in sixth class she got her first ipod, it wasn't an apple ipod though so more of a walkman but it wasn't sony either.
        She has hundreads of songs in its small 2GB memory. It was extremely cute and is now a treasure.

            Simran's aunt had a flip phone that she was obsessed with, she would love playing games in it and playing music.
